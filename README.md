# Electoral college vote map

**A d3 map to show US states with icons representing number of electoral votes, 
option to display total of Republican/Democrat votes and download as SVG.**

### Todo
* Fix state order and some that aren't tallied in total
* Set up default start position of sure blue and red states
* Expand northeast section for better visibility (?)
* Take some kind of input file to set state position (e.g. csv upload?)

Also: Talk to graphic designers!
